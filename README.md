Coordinate playing the game of [Assassin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassin_(game)), without the need for a game host. To use:

1. Download the game files. (ie, this repository)
2. Replace the example names in `players.txt` with the names of your players. Type one name per line.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the folder containing the game files. Run

        python assassins.py

   There are no dependencies besides Python 3.

4. Each player can then secretly type in their name and see their target.
